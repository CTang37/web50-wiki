CSS (standing for Cascading Style Sheets) is a programming language that can be used to add styling elements, in the form of "style sheets", to an [HTML](/HTML) page, such as colors, margins, images, and tables. As HTML became more complex through the 1990s, achieving consistency across applications and websites was becoming more and more difficult; as a result, CSS began to be adopted to formalize and standardize front-end web design.
